# This project uses AGENTS.md

We use `AGENTS.md` as our universal project context file instead of tool-specific files.

**Why AGENTS.md**: It's a vendor-neutral standard (from OpenAI, July 2025) that works across Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants. Contributors can use different tools while sharing the same context.

**For project context**: See `AGENTS.md`
